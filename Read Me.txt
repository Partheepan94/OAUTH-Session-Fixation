Starting the localhost server procedure - 

Change the absolute path in the env file of the variable DB_DATABASE to the absolute path the sqlite file

Start the server:
php artisan serve

Due to issues with the use of sqlite some of the commands for updating database currently not working.
The project which would be more efficient using microsoft sql service but due to limitations 
of the project size, therefore I used sqlite.
